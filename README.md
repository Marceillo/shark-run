# Shark-Run 

Welcome to Shark-Run live program [Shark-Run](https://shark-run-e1a617839e7e.herokuapp.com/).

The game is a word guessing game similar to the old hangman game.
Only in this game you have a kayaker and a shark trying to both educate each other.
The reality we should learn to live in the same world with each other.
The dictionery words are based on the shark and kayak words.
